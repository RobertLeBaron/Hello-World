# Hello-World
Bits and Peaces

I had the IT stuff since longer in my mind. In the past I had no grid to cope with coding language since I felt it to abstract. 
Nowadays things become easier to learn and it makes me intriegue to use a coding language not only to fullfill requirements of the clients and industry, but also creating creative things on my own.
